An IP address (version 4) takes the form w.x.y.z where w x y and z are numbers in the range 0
â€“ 255, e.g. 192.168.34.10. It would be a mistake to any of the numbers was negative, or greater than
255.

Write a program which prompts the user to input a valid IP address. The program should use a
counting loop to input the 4 numbers of the IP address, and use an input validation loop to ensure
that the number is valid before proceeding. Once a valid number has been input, it should be added
to the IP address.
