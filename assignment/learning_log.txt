Environment set up
- Set up a workspace with the CSV file that I am going to be working on
- Set up a utilities folder where I will keep all my functions (Grouped in files by function name)
- Set up a log file that every function will write to and output useful debugging information for the developer (potentially)
- Create a test suite folder with test_python files that is going to contain unit test for all the function in the utilities folder
